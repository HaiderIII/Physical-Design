## Question 1

What was the primary cause of the initial placement failure?

- [ ] A) Missing liberty files
- [X] B) Die area too small for IO pins
- [ ] C) Wrong clock frequency
- [ ] D) Invalid cell names

---

## Question 2

What is the relationship between "utilization" and "core area"?

- [ ] A) Utilization = Core area / Die area
- [X] B) Utilization = Cell area / Core area
- [ ] C) Utilization = Core area / Cell area
- [ ] D) Utilization = Die area / Cell area

## Question 3

For a design with 4 um² of cells, what minimum core area is needed at 60% utilization?

- [ ] A) 2.4 um²
- [ ] B) 4.0 um²
- [X] C) 6.67 um²
- [ ] D) 10.0 um²

## Question 4

Why is 95% density target problematic for advanced nodes?

- [ ] A) It's too slow for timing
- [X] B) It leaves no room for routing and buffer insertion
- [ ] C) It uses too much power
- [ ] D) It requires more metal layers

---

## Question 5

What is a typical density target for ASAP7 (7nm) designs?

- [ ] A) 90-95%
- [ ] B) 80-90%
- [X] C) 50-70%
- [ ] D) 20-30%

## Question 6

The IO pin error mentioned "die perimeter". What does increasing die size do for IO pins?

- [ ] A) Makes pins smaller
- [X] B) Increases available perimeter for pin placement
- [ ] C) Reduces pin count requirements
- [ ] D) Changes pin layer assignment

---

## Question 7

In the fixed floorplan, utilization was ~4.4%. Why is this acceptable?

- [ ] A) It's not acceptable - should be higher
- [ ] B) Lower utilization means less power consumption
- [X] C) It provides margin for buffer insertion and routing
- [ ] D) ASAP7 requires very low utilization
